### FYI :
- You have to complete all the coding problems.
- Read questions thoroughly - You should explore the classes and attempt to understand why each one is there.
- I encourage you to Google in order to assist in your understanding of a concept, however, copying and pasting code is simply hurting you at the end of the day. Try to understand   what is being asked of you and implement the answers for yourself.
- We will be reviewing everyones midterm answers in class together on submission date. Please make sure you can explain your answers.

# BEST OF LUCK TO YOU ALL
